# Jason Antao: My Image Repository

  

## How To Setup

My image repository including tests is created to be versatile, useful, and with the user's actions at the forefront of its design. 

It is built with Python & Django. 

To run this on your computer, do the following:

- Clone my repository
- In the terminal, from the root of the project folder, run `python manage.py runserver `
  - If the above step doesn't start the server right away, try running `source myproject/bin/activate` first then run `python manage.py runserver `
- Go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` on your browser, like Chrome, to view my image repository!

Note: If the  `python manage.py runserver ` command yields an error, try creating a virtual environment first and making sure you are running python and have run `pip install`. This step is a troubleshooting step so you probably won't have to do this - but everyone's system is setup different so I thought I'd mention it to save you time. 

## How It Works

You can do a bunch of things on my project, but of course it serves the core functionality of being an image repository.
